    <h3>COVID-19 vaccines be ready for distribution</h3>
    <p>
      The vaccines must be proven safe and effective in large (phase III) clinical trials.  
      Some COVID-19 vaccine candidates have completed their phase III trials, and many other potential vaccines are being developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Independent reviews of the efficacy and safety evidence is required for each vaccine candidate, including regulatory review and approval in the country where the vaccine is manufactured, before WHO considers a vaccine candidate for prequalification.

    <h3>Why does covid19india.org have different numbers compared to MOHFW website?</h3>
    <p>
      The vaccines must be manufactured in large quantities, which is a major and unprecedented challenge â€“ all the while continuing to produce other life-saving vaccines already in use.  
      As a final step, all approved vaccines will require distribution through a complex logistical process, with rigorous stock management and temperature control.

    <h3>Where can I find the data for this?</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to review of the data for regulatory purposes, the evidence must also be reviewed for the purpose of policy recommendations on how the vaccines should be used.

    <h3>Why are you guys putting in time and resources while not gaining a single penny from it?</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to review of the data for regulatory purposes, the evidence must also be reviewed for the purpose of policy recommendations on how the vaccines should be used.  
      Officials in individual countries decide whether to approve the vaccines for national use and develop policies for how to use the vaccines in their country based on the WHO recommendations.
